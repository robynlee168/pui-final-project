        <h2>SCORPIUS</h2>
        <div class="description">
            <p>Scorpius constellation lies in the southern sky. It represents the scorpion and is associated with the story of Orion in Greek mythology. Scorpius pre-dates the Greeks, and is one of the oldest constellations known.<p>
            <p>In Greek mythology, the constellation Scorpius was identified with the scorpion that stung Orion, the mythical hunter. The two constellations lie opposite each other in the sky, and Orion is said to be fleeing from the scorpion as it sets just as Scorpius rises. In one version of the myth, Orion tried to ravish the goddess Artemis and she sent the scorpion to do away with him. In another version, it was the Earth that sent the scorpion after Orion had boasted that he could defeat any wild beast.</p>
