        <h2>LEO</h2>
        <div class="description">
            <p>Leo constellation lies in the northern sky. It is one of the zodiac constellations and one of the largest constellations in the sky. Leo represents the lion and is usually associated with the Nemean lion in Greek mythology.</p>
            <p><strong>Story:</strong> The Greeks associated Leo with the Nemean lion, the beast defeated by Heracles during the first of his twelve labours. Both Eratosthenes and Hyginus wrote that the lion was placed among the constellations because it was the king of beasts. The lion lived in a cave in Nemea, a town located to the south-west of Corinth. It set upon the local inhabitants and could not be defeated because it had impenetrable skin.</p>
