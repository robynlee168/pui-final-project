        <h2>HYDRA</h2>
        <div class="description">
            <p>Hydra, the water snake, is the largest constellation in the sky. It lies in the southern celestial hemisphere, stretching across 1303 square degrees of the southern sky.</p>
            <p><strong>Story:</strong> The constellation Hydra is associated with the water snake on which Apollo’s crow blamed its tardiness. The god had sent the bird, represented by the constellation Corvus, to fetch him some water in a cup. The cup is associated with the constellation Crater. The crow was distracted by a fig tree and stopped to feast. When it finally returned to Apollo, it said the water snake was to blame, but the god saw through the bird’s lie and punished it by placing it into the sky. Apollo also turned the water snake and the cup into constellations. In the sky, the water snake (Hydra) eternally prevents the crow (Corvus) from drinking out of the cup (Crater).</p>
