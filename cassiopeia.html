        <h2>CASSIOPEIA</h2>
        <div class="description">
            <p>Cassiopeia is a large constellation located in the northern sky. It was named after Cassiopeia, the vain and boastful queen in Greek mythology. Nicknamed the W constellation, Cassiopeia is easily recognizable for the prominent W asterism formed by its five brightest stars.</p>
            <p><strong>Story:</strong> Cassiopeia was the wife of King Cepheus (represented by the neighbouring constellation Cepheus in the sky) of Ethiopia. Once, she boasted that she was more beautiful than the Nereids. The Nereids were the 50 sea nymphs fathered by the Titan Nereus. They were enraged by Cassiopeiaâ€™s comments and appealed to Poseidon to punish Cassiopeia for her boastfulness. It was Poseidon who placed Cassiopeia and Cepheus in the sky. Cassiopeia, the myth goes, was condemned to circle the celestial pole forever, and spends half the year upside down in the sky as punishment for her vanity. She is usually depicted on her throne, still combing her hair.</p>
